Heyyy, my name is Rafael, I am 20 years old and studying medicine. This year I am the
Commissioner Internal Affairs and Vice-Chairman. For me it is important that there is a good
atmosphere in the association and that everyone feels comfortable with what they do.
I have found my passion in powerlifting, which I enjoy doing. The environment at Profectus
has supported me and helped me achieve my goals.
This was also my motivation to join the board. I want to give new members the same positive
and welcoming experience I received when I joined Profectus.
Fun fact: for working out in the gym, you don't just need strong hips. You also need very
loose hips. That's why I also love to dance Latin so much.
