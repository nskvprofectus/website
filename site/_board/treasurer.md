Hi, I am Lisan and I am happy to tell you that I currently serve as the treasurer of NSKV
Profectus. I became a member around September 2023. What really spoke to me about
Profectus is that it really feels like a big friend group that trains together. And as a bonus you
get fun activities outside the gym as well! I really love that everyone is welcome, no matter
your gym journey. 

I started going to the gym around 2021 and fell in love with the progress
from day 1. Within Profectus I learned about powerlifting and in the beginning of this uni year
I competed in my first official competition. The support from Profectus is amazing! I am
looking forward to a joyful year full of excitement and cannot wait to expand our amazing
friend group.
