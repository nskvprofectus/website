Hello! My name is Benthe, and I am currently serving as the secretary of NSKV Profectus. I
began my powerlifting journey two years ago, and one of the first things I did upon moving to
Nijmegen was join Profectus. I’m proud to say I've now been a dedicated member for over a
year, and from the very start, Profectus has felt like a warm, welcoming family. The support
and friendships I’ve found here mean the world to me, and as secretary, I am grateful for the
chance to give back to the association in a meaningful way. I look forward to a year filled
with joy, learning, and the opportunity to connect with even more amazing people.
