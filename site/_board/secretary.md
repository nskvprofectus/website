Hi! I’m Eline, the current secretary of NSKV Profectus. I’ve been an active member of the association for almost two and a half years now, which is also when I started my strength sports journey. Right from the start, the association has been incredibly welcoming and supportive and I’ve met some great friends here. Being the secretary provides me the opportunity to meaningfully engage with and give back to Profectus. During my year as board, I hope to provide the same encouraging and gezellige (for lack of a better word) atmosphere – to make new members feel at home and continue the association’s growth.
