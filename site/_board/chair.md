Hi! I’m Eva and I have been a proud and active member of Profectus for 2,5 years now!
Currently, I am the Chair of the association and together with my other board members,
we’re excited to make this a memorable year for everyone! 

Back in ‘22, I joined the
association with 0 experience or knowledge about strength sports, but due to the supportive
and welcoming atmosphere in our community, I have developed myself as a competitive
powerlifter! Therefore, I hope that we can welcome a lot of new members to our association
to help them in their fitness journey and to make fun memories with each other in and
outside the gym!
