Hey! I’m Farzad, I’m 23 years old and currently studying medicine. I have a ton of hobbies
and can never seem to pick just one—I love singing, dancing, flying, and basically trying
anything new I can learn. Right now, I’m into semi-powerlifting at Profectus, and I’m also the
Commissioner of External Affairs. I joined the board because I was inspired by how much I
enjoyed the association and wanted to contribute to it myself. Plus, I get to work with a
fantastic team of friends, and we’re always there to support each other.
Fun fact about me: I’m so random that, as a medical student, I learned Python programming
one summer just because I was bored. It has absolutely nothing to do with my studies, but I
love picking up new skills!
