My name is Casper, and my role this year is to be the general member for Profectus. I fulfill multiple roles, ranging from managing the social media channels to assisting the secretary. 

I've been a competitive powerlifter for around 3 years, and training for 5. I’ve done multiple competitions, the latest being the Dutch national student championships. 

I’m positive in the upcoming years, where we will grow and help new members become the best version of themselves!
