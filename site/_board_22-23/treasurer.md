My name is Mink, and I serve as the treasurer for Profectus for this year. I make sure the association stays financially healthy and we make the most of our budget. 

Iâ€™ve been training in powerlifting for about a year and still see great improvements in my technique, approach to fitness and overall numbers. I think strength sports are a great way to exercise, and are very exciting as relative to other sports it is easier to gauge progression. But the most important thing to me is exercising safely and I think Profectus nurtures that mentality.

I hope we as an association can continue to grow, spread our knowledge and help each other get the most out of ourselves.
