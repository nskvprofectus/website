I'm Eva , a proud member of Profectus for the past 1.5 years and currently serving as Vice Chair for several months. In this role, I've had the privilege of leading committees and contributing to the positive atmosphere within our association.
For me, the most important aspect is finding enjoyment in powerlifting. I believe that sports is a great way to feel good, especially when fun takes the lead. As your Vice Chair, my commitment is to ensure everyone feels valued and connected.
I'm excited to continue building on our shared enthusiasm and dedication. Feel free to reach out anytime!
