Hey! I’m Julius. Chairman of NSKV Profectus. Personally, I joined this association to further develop my powerlifting skills and join competitions. Quickly I fell in love with Profectus and its people, a tight, supportive and friendly community where everybody can be themselves.

Currently, as chair I mainly support my fellow board members. Furthermore I try to make every member feel at home, just like I felt when I joined. I’m always open to chat, so feel free to come by whenever.
