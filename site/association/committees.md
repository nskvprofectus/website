Our commitment to enhancing the member experience is reflected through three key committees: the Social Media committee, Merchandise committee, and Activities committee. Additionally, we have the mock meet committee that organizes our yearly mock meet.

These committees enhance the overall Profectus experience for our members, and put the _student_ in the student sports association. By embracing the power of social media, offering stylish merchandise, and organizing engaging activities, we aim to create a community that celebrates strength, diversity, and the pursuit of personal excellence.
